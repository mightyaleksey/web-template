# Web Template

Project templates designed to save time during initial setup. So instead of spending long hours on reading manuals, just pick one of those and start building things.


## Description

All the project templates are powered by [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev). And have a necessary configuration for the [flowtype](https://flow.org).


## How to

Choose a template:
```
npm run start
```

This will copy necessary files to the project folder. After that just install dependencies and clean up unnecessary files:

```
npm install
rm -rf scripts templates
```
